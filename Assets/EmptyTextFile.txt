You have just escaped from your prison cell into the sewer system below. Before you can start making your way through, you hear
the sound of water rapidly approaching from behind. The safe option would be to head back to your cell but the next junction ahead
is in sight and you are tempted to make a run for it as you would be safe around the corner.

What do you do?
1. Climb back into your cell and wait out the water.
2. Make a run for the junction and risk a watery death.
